Analysing COVID-19 infection statistics in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.

## Description
We have experienced [many COVID waves in Sydney](https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-coronavirus-update-new-wave-of-covid19-in-nsw-as-omicron-variant-cases-rise/7393efb5-cf3a-4f1a-a505-62e45e7c4300), so I thought it would be interesting to analyse the data on COVID cases, statewide.

## Technologies
Primarily, I used:
* Jupyter Notebook 6.4.11
* Python 3.8.8
  
The data was imported using the `pandas` library in Python, then cleaned using `sqlite` in the Jupyter Notebook.
